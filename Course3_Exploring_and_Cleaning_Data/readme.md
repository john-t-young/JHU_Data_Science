# **JHU -- Course 3 | Exploring and Cleaning Data**

## Summary

Exploring and cleaning data isn't the sexiest part of the data science toolkit but it is the most important.  In fact if we're applying the 80/20 rule, data cleanup and normalization is the majority of what data scientists have to do, day in and day out.  Without clean data sets, no matter how fancy or sophisticated the algorithm, the end result is always inaccurate.  The old adage applies: garbage in, garbage out.
