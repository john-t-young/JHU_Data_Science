Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project ReadMe
================================================
Data Zip File Location: [UC Irvine Repo](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

This project is a test of the student's abilities to apply data cleanup and processing skills learned from earlier course lectures as Part 3 of a 10 part series for John Hopkins University's Data Science Coursera Course.  The data is provided from a volunteer experiment set testing physical activities of random participants conducted at UC Irvine.  The project requirements are included below including links to final project deliverables. 


Final Project Instruction Set
-----------------------------
Create R script, named run_analysis.R that performs the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


Final Project Deliverables
------------------------
1. Tidy Data Set
2. Link to Github repository with script for cleaning and prepping data as well as readme file and tidy set text file.
3. Codebook with variables description
4. Readme for Final Project Code and Setup
